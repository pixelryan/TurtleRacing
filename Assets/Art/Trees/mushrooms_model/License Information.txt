NOTES

1. I strongly suggest you to use blog shadows under mushrooms. That way they will look much better.
2. Feel free to edit texture file. Add circles to a hat, change colour, make it darker or lighter. In other words: make it fit perfect for your game.
3. To make it look ceramic and artifical just add specularity to a material. Simply as that.

Thank you and enjoy!
